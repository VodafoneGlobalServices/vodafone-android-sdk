## Development

### Logging

LoggerFactory is build type dependant implementation. The difference is that
when you build SDK in debug mode it will log network communications but
it won't do so in release mode.

Different implementations are located at
`/sdk/src/debug/java/com/vodafone/global/sdk/logging/LoggerFactory.java`
and
`/sdk/src/release/java/com/vodafone/global/sdk/logging/LoggerFactory.java`

### Testing and code coverage

To run tests and generate reports run following command

    ./gradlew :sdk:clean :sdk-test:clean :sdk:assemble :sdk-test:test :sdk-test:jacocoTestReport

Tests report can be found at
`sdk-test/build/reports/tests/index.html`

Code coverage report can be found at
`sdk-test/build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`
